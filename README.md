# Numerical Methods (Maths)

This is my collection of useful mathematical numerical methods which I have both gathered from external sources and self-coded on the followinf modules at university:

- Module at the University of Warwick called "Differential Equations: Modelling & Numerics". (MA261 ODEs)
- Module at the University of Barcelona called "Mètodes Numerics I". (360146 MNI)
- Module at the University of Barcelona called "Mètodes Numèrics II". (360147 MNII)
